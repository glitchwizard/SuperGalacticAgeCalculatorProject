2. Specifications:
  * Spec 1: Collect the users age, in years
- [ ] **Expect:** An integer value representing the users name in years 
Input: 33 
Output: 33 Earth years

  * Spec 2: Calculate the users age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
- [ ] **Expect:**  the users age in earth years
Input: 33  
Output: 137 Mercury years

  * Spec 3: Calculate the users age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
- [ ] **Expect:**  the users age in earth years

  * Spec 6: Calculate the users remaining life expectancy on each planet. For males the average life expectancy in this project is assumed to be 85 years, while for women it's expected to be about 87 years.
- [ ] **Expect:**  the users age in earth years
Input: 33
Output: 

Here is your life expectancy for each planet.
If you're male, you can expect to live to be 85 earth years, which would mean you'd have the following remaining years on each planet: 

52 more local years if you were living on Earth
217 more local years if you were living on Mercury
84 more local years if you were living on Venus
28 more local years if you were living on Mars
5 more local years if you were living on Jupiter

If you're female, you can expect to live to be 85 earth years, which would mean you'd have the following remaining years on each planet: 

52 more local years if you were living on Earth
217 more local years if you were living on Mercury
84 more local years if you were living on Venus
28 more local years if you were living on Mars
5 more local years if you were living on Jupiter





  * Spec 7: Calculate the users age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
- [ ] **Expect:**  the users age in earth years
Input: 33
Output: 2 Jupiter years
